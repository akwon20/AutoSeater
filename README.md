# AutoSeater Application
A Java Application that generates a rectangular seating chart for an elementary school carpet-based scenario.
Users can input a specific list of student names along with their desired restrictions (who cannot sit next to whom)
and adjacencies (who must sit next to whom) to automatically generate a seating chart and reallocate the amount of time
and effort required to other tasks teachers deal with.
